    &6&lCongratulations!
    &eYou finished the VaultMC tour. Now you have a basic understanding of what VaultMC is and what VaultMC provides.

    uhc:
      title: "&eUHC"
      text: |-
        &6&lUHC
        &eUHC means Ultra Hardcore Champion. It is survival with a world border that's constantly shrinking and PvP.
        &a-
        &eOn VaultMC, we have two modes of UHC: Normal and Cursed. Before the game begins, you can vote for a mode. If you voted for cursed mode, a random cursed mode between Entities Speed Boost, Inventory Swap, Location Swap, Random Drops, Random Potion Effect and PvP Starts Immediately is used.
        &a-
        &eEach round of UHC on VaultMC lasts for 45 minutes (except for PvP Starts Immediately which lasts for 35 minutes). There is a grace period of 10 minutes where you can't combat with others in the beginning.

    lobby:

        &6&lLobby
        &eThe lobby is where your experience on VaultMC starts.
        &a-
        &eWhile in the lobby, you will be given a paper. Right click
        &ethe paper to open the Server Navigator, where you can
        &ejoin different worlds and servers.

    skyblock:
      title: "&eSkyBlock"
      text: |-
        &6&lSkyBlock
        &eIt's like survival, but you survive on a floating island.
        &a-
        &eYou can create a cobblestone generator to gather the required resources. The cobblestone generator will even generate diamonds!
        &a-
        &eUse &6/is create&e to create your island or &6/is request <name>&e to send a request to co-op on an existing island. You should follow &6/is achievements&e to proceed on your adventure.
        &a-
        &eIf you played on the legacy VaultMC server, you can contact an administrator to recover your old island.

    survival:
      title: "&eSurvival and Clans"
      text-survival: |-
        &6&lSurvival
        &eSurvival has been a huge part of VaultMC's gameplay since its beginning. It's about generally having fun exploring and creating.
        &a-
        &eWhile in survival, you can use &6/claim&e to claim a chunk of land as yours. You can also use &6/claim add <player>&e and &6/claim remove <player>&e to allow/disallow players from interacting within your claim.
        &a-
        &eWe know sleeping could be a problem while surviving. For your convinence, if half (or above) of players in the Survival world are sleeping, the night will be skipped.

      text-clans: |-
        &6&lClans
        &eClans is generally Factions that you play on most of the servers, however it is simplified to make it easier to understand.
        &a-
        &eTo get started in Clans, you can use &6/c create <clan>&e to create a clan, much like creating a Faction. You can also use &6/c join <clan>&e to join an existing clan.
        &a-

  history:
    title: "&e&lHistory of VaultMC"

    # I hope we can find the legacy island-ish lobby (We did!)
    displaying-legacy-lobby: |-
      &6&lThe very beginning
      &eOn February 11th 2019, the idea of VaultMC began.
      &e2xjtn and Aberdeener started brain storming ideas for game modes, ranks and plugins right away.
      &eOnly a couple days later 2xjtn brought his friend yangyang200 in to the project, he began development on the VaultCore plugin immediately.
      &eWe're excited to see what happens next.

    displaying-players: |-
      &6&lAn accident
      &eExactly one week later we (accidentally) launched for the world.
      &eWe had a strong month of 5-10 players online at all times, but unfortunately due to lack of management, staff and general disagreements we closed our doors.
      &a-
      &e(You can turn now)

    # Exactly redstoner history about lack of management, staff and general disagreements.

    displaying-new-lobby: |-
      &6&lA new start
      &eIt remained that way until August 2019. After a lengthy break, we were ready to give it another shot.
      &eSince then we have been adding rewriting nearly all the plugins to our custom suite, developing new game modes and expanding our network to include multiple servers.
      &a-
      &e(You can still turn)
