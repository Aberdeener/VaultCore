        &6&lSurvival
        &eSurvival has been a huge part of VaultMC's gameplay since its
        &ebeginning. It's about generally having fun exploring and creating.

        &eWhile in survival, you can use &6/claim&e to claim a chunk of land
        &eas yours. You can also use &6/claim add <player>&e and &6/claim
        &6remove <player>&e to allow/disallow players from interacting within your claim.

        &eWe know sleeping could be a problem while surviving. For your
        &econvinence, if half (or above) of the player slept, the night
        &ewill be skipped.

      text-clans: |-
        &6&lClans
        &eClans is generally Factions that you play on most of the servers, however it is simplified to make it easier to understand.

        &eTo get started in Clans, you can use &6/c create <clan>&e to create a clan, much like creating a Faction. You can also use &6/c join <clan>&e to join an existing clan.

        &eFor more information on Clans, you can visit
        &ehttps://github.com/VaultMC/VaultClans/wiki/Introduction-to-the-clans-gameplay.

  history:

    # I hope we can find the legacy island-ish lobby
    displaying-legacy-lobby: |-
      &6&lThe very beginning
      &eOn February 11th 2019, the idea of VaultMC began.
      &e2xjtn and Aberdeener started brain storming ideas for game modes, ranks and plugins right away.
      &eOnly a couple days later 2xjtn brought his friend yangyang200 in to the project, he began development on the VaultCore plugin immediately.
      &eWe're excited to see what happens next.

    displaying-players: |-
      &6&lAn accident
      &eExactly one week later we (accidentally) launched for the world.
      &eWe had a strong month of 5-10 players online at all times, but unfortunately due to lack of management, staff and general disagreements we closed our doors.

      &e(You may turn now)

    # Exactly redstoner history about lack of management, staff and general disagreements.

    displaying-new-lobby: |-
      &6&lA new start
      &eIt remained that way until August 2019. After a lengthy break, we were ready to give it another shot.
      &eSince then we have been adding rewriting nearly all the plugins to our custom suite, developing new game modes and expanding our network to include multiple servers.
