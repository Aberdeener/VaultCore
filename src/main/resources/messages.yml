        &eWhile in survival, you can use &6/claim&e to claim a chunk of land as yours. You can also use &6/claim add <player>&e and &6/claim remove <player>&e to allow/disallow players from interacting within your claim.
        &eWe have a unique system for survival that contains modded items. However, you can also play for a vanilla experience. Use &6/crafting&e to find out all the craftable modded items.

    # I hope we can find the legacy island-ish lobby (We did!)
    displaying-legacy-lobby: |-
      &6&lThe very beginning
      &eOn February 11th 2019, the idea of VaultMC began.
      &e2xjtn and Aberdeener started brain storming ideas for game modes, ranks and plugins right away.
      &eOnly a couple days later 2xjtn brought his friend yangyang200 in to the project, he began development on the VaultCore plugin immediately.
      &eWe're excited to see what happens next.

    displaying-players: |-
      &6&lAn accident
      &eExactly one week later we (accidentally) launched for the world.
      &eWe had a strong month of 5-10 players online at all times, but unfortunately due to lack of management, staff and general disagreements we closed our doors.
      &a-
      &e(You can turn now)

    displaying-new-lobby: |-
      &6&lA new start
      &eIt remained that way until August 2019. After a lengthy break, we were ready to give it another shot.
      &eSince then we have been adding rewriting nearly all the plugins to our custom suite, developing new game modes and expanding our network to include multiple servers.
